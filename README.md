# Excess speed limits = lower music volume
## Goal
This is an Android application aiming to encourage a driver to respect speed limits, by reducing music volume when exceeding speed limit. It uses GPS and data connection.

## Install instructions
The application requires at least Android Kitkat (4.4, API 19). 

The app is not on the Play Store, so first you'll need to authorize unknown sources
Download and execute on the phone the [Android package (APK)](https://github.com/glae/exceed_speed_limits_then_lower_music/releases)

**Warning**: the app is very volume-related intrusive (foreground and background), you'll need to kill it to restore normal music volume use.
